# 📁 Java File Manager – DSA Project

A file manager built in Java using core data structures and Swing for GUI. This project demonstrates practical applications of data structures like **generic trees** and **stacks** to simulate file system hierarchies and navigation.

## 🔧 Features
- Visual file hierarchy using a **generic tree** structure
- **Stack-based navigation** for back/forward functionality
- Interactive **GUI using Java Swing**
- Basic file operations: open, delete, create (customizable)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing
- Netbeans or any other IDE

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Applied **data structures** in a real-world simulation
- Built an interactive GUI using **event-driven programming**
- Improved understanding of **file system navigation** logic
